      <h1>What are audio effects?</h1>
      <p>
        Audio effects are analog or digital devices that are used to intentionally alter how a musical instrument or other audio source sounds. Effects can be subtle or extreme, and they can be used in live or recording situations. A good example of audio effects are the “stomp boxes” that many electric guitarists use to achieve their desired sound.By chaining together many different types of effects, a musician can sculpt a unique tone and enhance their music in many ways.

      <h1>Basic digital audio signal processing</h1>
      <p class="popContent">
        All sounds we hear with our ears are pressure waves in air.
        Digital recording samples the waveform at evenly-spaced timepoints, representing each sample as a precise number. For example, in CD audio, samples are taken 44100 times per second each with 16 bit

        <span-keyword>sample depth.</span-keyword></a>
         Digital recordings, whether stored on a compact disc (CD), digital audio tape (DAT), or on a personal computer, do not degrade over time and can be copied perfectly without introducing any additional noise. The following image illustrates a sampled audio waveform:
         <div class="hide popover" id="div1">
          <span-popover>Bit depth is the number of bits of information in each sample  and it directly corresponds to the resolution of each sample.Bit depth is only meaningful in reference to a PCM digital signal.</span-popover>

      </div>

      <p>
        In a digital audio system, an analog electrical signal representing the sound is converted with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) into a digital signal, typically using <a href="div3" id="pop3" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover"><span-keyword>pulse-code modulation</span-keyword></a>. This digital signal can then be recorded, edited, modified, and copied using computers, audio playback machines, and other digital tools. When the sound engineer wishes to listen to the recording on headphones or loudspeakers (or when a consumer wishes to listen to a digital sound file), a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) performs the reverse process, converting a digital signal back into an analog signal, which is then sent through an audio power amplifier and ultimately to a loudspeaker. 
      </p>
       <div class="hide" id="div3">
        <span-popover>
          <span-popover-keyword>Pulse-code modulation</span-popover-keyword> is a method used to digitally represent sampled analog signals. It is the standard form of digital audio in computers, compact discs, digital telephony and other digital audio applications. In a PCM stream, the amplitude of the analog signal is sampled regularly at uniform intervals, and each sample is quantized to the nearest value within a range of digital steps. 
        </span-popover>
      </div> 

      <p>
        Digital audio can be edited and mixed without introducing any additional noise. In addition, many digital effects can be applied to digitized audio recordings, for example, to simulate reverberation, enhance certain frequencies, or shift the <a href="div2" id="pop2" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover"><span-keyword>pitch</span-keyword>

        <span-popover><span-popover-keyword>Pitch</span-popover-keyword> is the quality of a sound represented by the rate of virbations producing it.
          Also, it can be defined as the <i>highness</i> or <i>lowness</i> of a tone.
        </span-popover>
      </div> 
      </p>
    
      <p><i><b>What does shifting the pitch refer to? </b></i>Pitch shifting represents a technique, in which the original pitch of the sound is raised or lowered by a preset interval.
        Usually, the simplest methods are used to raise the pitch and reduce the duration, or vice-versa. This means replaying the original sound at a higher pace than it was recorded.

              <h3>How does Chorus work?</h3>
              <p class="modal-text">Chorus as an electronic effect works in the following way: the chorus audio processor (whether a pedal, effects unit or plugin) makes copies of the original audio signal and applies delay and pitch-modulation (using 
                <a href="lfo" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" rel="popover">LFO</a>) to those copies.
              A stereo chorus does the same, with added <a href="panning" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" rel="popover">panning</a> in the delays and offset phase on the LFO. This causes those added copies and modulations to go between your left and right. The effect will sound fuller because of the movement in your stereo field.</p>

               <p class="modal-text" modal><i><b>Flanger</b></i> is an audio effect produced by mixing two identical signals together, one signal delayed by a small and gradually changing period, usually smaller than 20 milliseconds. This produces a swept comb filter effect: peaks and notches are produced in the resulting frequency spectrum, related to each other in a linear harmonic series. Varying the time delay causes these to sweep up and down the frequency spectrum.</p>
               <h3>How does the flanger work?</h3>
               <p class="modal-text">
                 Flanging, while sonically similar to Phasing, is functionally closer to a Chorus. It uses a short delay (0.1ms – ~10ms) and modulates it against the dry signal with an LFO. If you kept extending the delay time on a flanger you’d end up with a chorus.It has the ability to feedback the processed signal to the input which further reinforces and intensifies the effect.

               <p class="modal-text" modal><i><b>A phaser</b></i> is an electronic sound processor used to filter a signal by creating a series of peaks and troughs in the frequency spectrum. The position of the peaks and troughs of the waveform being affected is typically modulated so that they vary over time, creating a sweeping effect. For this purpose, phasers usually include a low-frequency oscillator. </p>
               <h3>How does the phaser work?</h3>
               <p class="modal-text">
                 A phaser uses <a href="allpass" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover" rel="popover">All-Pass Filters</a> instead of a delay line, but it’s a broadly similar concept and sound to the flanger. The filters create notches when mixed back with the dry signal and an LFO sweeps them through the frequency range. The more “stages” a phaser has the more notches and therefore the more intense the sound will be.

               A reverberation, or reverb, is created when a sound or signal is reflected causing a large number of reflections to build up and then decay as the sound is absorbed by the surfaces of objects in the space – which could include furniture, people, and air.This is most noticeable when the sound source stops but the reflections continue, decreasing in amplitude, until they reach zero amplitude. </p>

The delayed signal may either be played back multiple times, or played back into the recording again, to create the sound of a repeating, decaying echo.
               Delay effects range from a subtle echo effect to a pronounced blending of previous sounds with new sounds.
               Delay effect can be used to create single echoes, as well as a number of other effects. Delays of 35 milliseconds or more create discrete echoes, while those between 15‑34 milliseconds can create a simple chorus or flanging effect.</p>

               <p class="modal-text">
                 Most delays work by playing back the dry signal while also playing back the wet or ‘delayed’ signal shortly after the original.
                 Early tape delay units featured a recording head and playback head(s) (also called a tap) a few inches apart. The result was an echoing of the recording signal shortly after it was played. Delay units with multiple taps and tape settings eventually gave artists the ability to playback multiple echoes at different intervals with a greater level of control.

                By cutting or boosting certain frequencies, EQ shapes the tone and character of your sound. EQing also changes the balance between the frequencies that are already there.

               <p class="modal-text" modal><i><b>Compression</b></i> is the reduction of dynamic range — the difference between the loudest and quietest parts of an audio signal. When compression is applied, the quieter parts of the signal are boosted and the louder ones are attenuated.</p>
               <h3>How does compression work?</h3>
               <p class="modal-text">
                 Compressors reduce the gain of your signal (‘GR’ stands for Gain Reduction on your DAW compressor). Compression reduces the dynamic range of a signal. The dynamic range is the difference between the loudest and the quietest parts of a signal.
                 Compressors lower the volume of loud peaks–they even out the notes that stick out in the mix. This allows you to bring up the gain of the whole signal without clipping.

              <p class="modal-text"><i><b>Overdrive</b></i>  - audio at a low input level is driven by higher input levels in a non-linear curve characteristic. For overdrive, Symmetrical soft clipping of input values has to be performed.  </p>
               <p class="modal-text" modal><i><b>Distortion</b></i> is an overloading of the audio circuit that causes the signal to clip. It might sound like something you wanna stay away from—but when used right it’s very effective as a creative tool. Bit-crushing is the lo-fi digital equivalent of the distortion effect.</p>
               <h3>How does distortion work?</h3>
               <p class="modal-text">
                 Distortion changes your original signal by pushing the sound to clip and compress. This adds harmonic content and colors the sound in a pleasant way. Bit-crushing works by reducing the resolution of a sound—specifically the sampling rate or the bit rate.
