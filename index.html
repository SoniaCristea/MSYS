      <h1>What are audio effects?</h1>
      <p>
        Audio effects are analog or digital devices that are used to intentionally alter how a musical instrument or other audio source sounds. Effects can be subtle or extreme, and they can be used in live or recording situations. A good example of audio effects are the “stomp boxes” that many electric guitarists use to achieve their desired sound. By chaining together many different types of effects, a musician can sculpt a unique tone and enhance their music in many ways.
      </p>
      <br></br>

      <h1>Basic digital audio signal processing</h1>
      <p>All sounds we hear with our ears are pressure waves in air.
        Digital recording works differently: it samples the waveform at evenly-spaced timepoints, representing each sample as a precise number. Digital recordings, whether stored on a compact disc (CD), digital audio tape (DAT), or on a personal computer, do not degrade over time and can be copied perfectly without introducing any additional noise. The following image illustrates a sampled audio waveform: 
      </p> 
      <img class="image" src="waveform_digital.png"></img>
      <p>
        Digital audio can be edited and mixed without introducing any additional noise. In addition, many digital effects can be applied to digitized audio recordings, for example, to simulate reverberation, enhance certain frequencies, or change the pitch. 
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <h1>Principles of digital audio signal processing</h1>
      <h3>1. Simple waveforms</h3>
      <img class="image" src="Capture.png"></img>
      <p class="subsection">• <span>Frequency</span> is the number of cycles per second and is measured in Hertz(Hz)</p>
      <p>• <span>Wavelength</span> is inversely proportional to frequency </p>
      <p>i.e. Wavelength varies as 1/frequency</p>
      <br></br>
      <h3>2. The Sine vs Cosine Wave and Sound</h3>
      <img class="image" src="sincos.png"></img>
    <p>
      The general form of the <span>sine</span> wave we shall use(quite a lot of) is as follows: </p>
       <p class="text-span"><i>y = A.sin(2π.n.Fw/Fs)</i></p>
       <p>where:</p>
       <p class="text-span2"><i>A</i> is the amplitude of the wave,</p>
       <p class="text-span2"><i>Fw</i> is the frequency of the wave, </p>
       <p class="text-span2"><i>Fs</i> is the sample frequency, </p>
       <p class="text-span2"><i>n</i> is the sample index</p>
       <p><span>Cosine</span> is same as Sine (except 90 degrees out of phase)</p>

              <p class="modal-text" modal><i>Chorus</i> is an effect obtained when similar sounds with slight variations in tuning and timing overlap and are heard as one.
              It happens naturally when multiple sources make a similar sound overlap. Think of a real life choir singing multiple parts at the same time. They all overlap to form a distinct sound. The chorus effect does the same thing!</p>

              <h3>How does Chorus work?</h3>
              <p class="modal-text">Chorus as an electronic effect works in the following way: the chorus audio processor (whether a pedal, effects unit or plugin) makes copies of the original audio signal and applies delay and pitch-modulation (using LFOs) to those copies.
              A stereo chorus does the same, with added panning in the delays and offset phase on the LFO. This causes those added copies and modulations to go between your left and right. The effect will sound fuller because of the movement in your stereo field.</p>

             <div class="modalP">
               <p class="modal-text"><i>Flanger</i> is an audio effect produced by mixing two identical signals together, one signal delayed by a small and gradually changing period, usually smaller than 20 milliseconds. This produces a swept comb filter effect: peaks and notches are produced in the resulting frequency spectrum, related to each other in a linear harmonic series. Varying the time delay causes these to sweep up and down the frequency spectrum. A flanger is an effects unit that creates this effect.</p>
               <h3>How does the flanger work?</h3>
               <p class="modal-text">
                 Flanging, while sonically similar to Phasing, is functionally closer to a Chorus. It uses a short delay (0.1ms – ~10ms) and modulates that against the dry signal with an LFO. If you kept extending the delay time on a flanger you’d end up with a chorus.It has the ability to feedback the processed signal to the input which further reinforces and intensifies the effect.

               <p class="modal-text"><i>A phaser</i> is an electronic sound processor used to filter a signal by creating a series of peaks and troughs in the frequency spectrum. The position of the peaks and troughs of the waveform being affected is typically modulated so that they vary over time, creating a sweeping effect. For this purpose, phasers usually include a low-frequency oscillator. </p>
               <h3>How does the phaser work?</h3>
               <p class="modal-text">
                 A phaser uses All-Pass Filters instead of a delay line, but it’s a broadly similar concept and sound to the flanger. The filters create notches when mixed back with the dry signal and an LFO sweeps them through the frequency range. The more “stages” a phaser has the more notches and therefore the more intense the sound will be.

               <p class="modal-text"><i>Reverberation</i>, in psychoacoustics and acoustics, is a persistence of sound after the sound is produced.
               A reverberation, or reverb, is created when a sound or signal is reflected causing a large number of reflections to build up and then decay as the sound is absorbed by the surfaces of objects in the space – which could include furniture, people, and air.This is most noticeable when the sound source stops but the reflections continue, decreasing in amplitude, until they reach zero amplitude. </p>
               <h3>How does reverb work?</h3>
               <p class="modal-text">
                 The most readily available reverb is the one found in natural spaces.
                 Digital reverbs and reverb plugins calculate the needed delay, level, frequency response and algorithmically generate multiple echoes. Reverb plugins do thousands of calculations per second—that’s why they’re often very CPU-intensive.

               <p class="modal-text"><i>Delay</i> is an audio effect and an effects unit which records an input signal to an audio storage medium, and then plays it back after a period of time. The delayed signal may either be played back multiple times, or played back into the recording again, to create the sound of a repeating, decaying echo.
               Delay effects range from a subtle echo effect to a pronounced blending of previous sounds with new sounds.
               Delay effect can be used to create single echoes, as well as a number of other effects. Delays of 35 milliseconds or more create discrete echoes, while those between 15‑34 milliseconds can create a simple chorus or flanging effect.</p>
               <h3>How does delay work?</h3>
               <p class="modal-text">
                 Most delays work by playing back the dry signal while also playing back the wet or ‘delayed’ signal shortly after the original.
                 Early tape delay units featured a recording head and playback head(s) (also called a tap) a few inches apart. The result was an echoing of the recording signal shortly after it was played. Delay units with multiple taps and tape settings eventually gave artists the ability to playback multiple echoes at different intervals with a greater level of control.

               Echo effect adds a series of repeated, decaying echoes to a sound. (For a single echo, use the Delay effect instead.) You can create effects ranging from a Grand Canyon‑type “Hello‑ello‑llo‑lo‑o” to metallic, clanging drainpipe sounds by varying the delay amount. By equalizing the delays, you can change a room’s characteristic sound from one with reflective surfaces (creating echoes that sound brighter) to one that is almost totally absorptive (creating echoes that sound darker).

               <p class="modal-text"><i>Equalization (or EQ)</i> is the cutting or boosting of a particular frequency (or range of frequencies) in the frequency spectrum.
              Humans can hear audio frequencies roughly between 20 and 20 000 Hertz (Hz). Any sound that human ears perceive sits somewhere in that frequency spectrum.
              An Equalizer (EQ) divides that spectrum into sections (called ‘bands’) that you use to cut or boost parts of your sound.</p>
              <h3>How does equalization work?</h3>
              <p class="modal-text">
                EQing is like sculpting: it shapes the existing frequencies of your sound. It doesn’t add new frequencies per se.
                By cutting or boosting certain frequencies, EQ shapes the tone and character of your sound. EQing also changes the balance between the frequencies that are already there.

               <p class="modal-text">
                 Compressors reduce the gain of your signal (‘GR’ stands for Gain Reduction on your DAW compressor). Compression reduces the dynamic range of a signal. The dynamic range is the difference between the loudest and the quietest parts of a signal.
                 Compressors lower the volume of loud peaks–they even out the notes that stick out in the mix. This allows you to bring up the gain of the whole signal without clipping.

                The steepness or aggressiveness of a filter is determined by its slope. The lower (or gentler) the slope, the less aggressively it attenuates the frequencies below or above its cutoff frequency. A 6dB per octave slope is gentle, whereas a 48dB per octave will have a much more audible effect.
                Most filters also have a “Resonance” control, which exaggerates the frequency band around the cutoff. At extreme settings some filters will self-oscillate and can even be played as an additional oscillator.
